I value keeping my work open source, but as you all know, _**plagiarism is bad**_. It's always disheartening whenever I find that someone has copied my work without giving me credit. I spent a non-trivial amount of effort building and designing this project, and I am proud of it! All I ask of you all is to not claim this effort as your own.
